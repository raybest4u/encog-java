/**
 * This package contains the classes for adaptive resonance theory (ART) 
 * networks.
 * 
 * Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) is a form of neural network developed 
 * by Stephen Grossberg and Gail Carpenter. There are several versions 
 * of the ART neural network, which are numbered ART-1, ART-2 and ART-3. 
 * The ART neural network is trained using either a supervised or 
 * unsupervised learning algorithm, depending on the version of ART being 
 * used. ART neural networks are used for pattern recognition and prediction.
 *
 * Plasticity is an important part for all Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) 
 * neural networks. Unlike most neural networks, ART networks do not have 
 * a distinct training and usage stage. The ART network will learn as it is 
 * used.

/**
 * Implements a chromosome to genetic algorithm. This is an abstract class.
 * Other classes are provided in this book that use this base class to train
 * neural networks or provide an answer to the traveling salesman problem.
 * 
 * Lifeforms in this genetic algorithm consist of one single chromosome each.
 * Therefore, this class represents a virtual lifeform. The chromosome is a
 * string of objects that represent one solution. For a neural network, this
 * string of objects usually represents the weight and threshold matrix.
 * 
 * Chromosomes are made up of genes. These are of the generic type GENE_TYPE.
 * For a neural network this type would most likely be double values.
 * 
 * @param <GENE_TYPE>
 *            The datatype for a gene.

/**
 * Backpropagation: This class implements a backpropagation training algorithm
 * for feed forward neural networks. It is used in the same manner as any other
 * training class that implements the Train interface.
 * 
 * Backpropagation is a common neural network training algorithm. It works by
 * analyzing the error of the output of the neural network. Each neuron in the
 * output layer's contribution, according to weight, to this error is
 * determined. These weights are then adjusted to minimize this error. This
 * process continues working its way backwards through the layers of the neural
 * network.
 * 
 * This implementation of the backpropagation algorithm uses both momentum and a
 * learning rate. The learning rate specifies the degree to which the weight
 * matrixes will be modified through each iteration. The momentum specifies how
 * much the previous learning iteration affects the current. To use no momentum
 * at all specify zero.

 * An activation function based on the logarithm function.
 * 
 * This type of activation function can be useful to prevent saturation. A
 * hidden node of a neural network is said to be saturated on a given set of
 * inputs when its output is approximately 1 or -1 "most of the time". If this
 * phenomena occurs during training then the learning of the network can be
 * slowed significantly since the error surface is very at in this instance.

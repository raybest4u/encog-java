/**
 * Generally, you will not want to use this randomizer as a pure neural network
 * randomizer. More on this later in the description.
 * 
 * Generate random numbers that fall within a Gaussian curve. The mean
 * represents the center of the curve, and the standard deviation helps
 * determine the length of the curve on each side.
 * 
 * This randomizer is used mainly for special cases where I want to generate
 * random numbers in a Gaussian range. For a pure neural network initializer, it
 * leaves much to be desired. However, it can make for a decent randomizer.
 * Usually, the Nguyen Widrow randomizer performs better.
 * 
 * Uses the "Box Muller" method.

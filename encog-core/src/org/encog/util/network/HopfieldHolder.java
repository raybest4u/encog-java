/**
 * This class holds a Hopfield network.  It provides tools to be used with
 * the Hopfield neural network.  
 * 
 * To use this class, add one or more patterns for the Hopfield network
 * to recognize.  These are added using the addPattern method.
 * 
 * The current state (getCurrentState) starts out all false.  Calling the
 * run method passes through one iteration.  The network will tend to 
 * decrease energy and move to one of the patterns it has been trained with
 * until it stabilizes. 
 * 
 * The current energy for the network can be obtained by calling 
 * calculateEnergy.  The network will seek to lower this energy value.
 * The energy value is a reflection of how far the current state is from
 * a pattern.

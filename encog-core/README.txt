About the Encog Project

Encog is an advanced neural network and machine learning framework. Encog contains classes 
to create a wide variety of networks, as well as support classes to normalize and process
data for these neural networks. Encog trains using multithreaded resilient propagation. Encog 
can also make use of a GPU to further speed processing time. A GUI based workbench is also provided 
to help model and train neural networks. Encog has been in active development since 2008.

Encog is available for Java, .Net and Silverlight.
